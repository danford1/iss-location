= 3D - Three.js # Learning : create Earth - V1

Classic example, but very fun for testing and discovering Three.js :
with controls panel, change more than 70 parameters,
and play with Sun, Earth and Moon, lens flares, textures,
bump mapping, animations, lights, shadows, ...

== Let's go for a V2

This repository is an import of
https://gist.github.com/jprivet-dev/ed47f7eb4ce89d743e1e50f42530d38f[Gist 3d-three-js-learning-create-earth],
to realize a V2.

As the JS script of the V1 becomes much too important (more than 1500 lines),
a V2 is in progress, with the latest version of Three.js,
a more adapted design pattern and a few more little ideas.

Deadline: approximately the end of 2018 :P

Work in progress on https://jprivet-dev.github.io/three.js-create-earth/ :)
